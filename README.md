# stripe-connect-python-flask
A simple webservice for a Stripe Connect Application


This is a working implementation of a Stripe Connect webservice using python and flask

All endpoints you would need to manage customers/merchants and payments are written (though not documented well yet)

I also have a terms of service mailgun implementation in there that I will explain in the wiki. 

Any questions, submit an issue and I'll get back to you.  Cheers!
